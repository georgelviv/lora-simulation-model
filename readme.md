# Lora Simulation — Lightweight LoRa PHY Simulator for Lora firmware

Lora Simulation is a lightweight and fast **LoRa physical layer simulator** implemented in Python.  
It is designed specifically for:

- Reinforcement Learning (RL) experiments  
- LoRa parameter auto-tuning  
- Rapid prototyping  
- Simulation of SF/BW/CR/TxPower effects  
- Research in IoT/CPS and wireless communication  

LoRaSim models RSSI, SNR, propagation, packet success/failure, Time-on-Air, and more — using equations and assumptions close to Semtech SX1276/78 chips.

## 📦 Installation
